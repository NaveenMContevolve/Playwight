Selenium vs. Playwright: A Comprehensive Comparison
1. Introduction Selenium and Playwright are two of the most popular automation frameworks for web testing and browser automation. While Selenium has been the industry standard for years, Playwright has gained popularity for its modern approach and enhanced capabilities. This document compares the two tools based on various factors such as architecture, performance, ease of use, language support, and ecosystem.

2. Architecture and Design
•	Selenium: Uses WebDriver, a protocol-based approach that communicates with browsers via drivers such as ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, etc.
•	Playwright: Uses a single WebSocket connection to interact with browsers, allowing for faster execution and more reliable automation.
3. Performance
•	Selenium: Due to WebDriver's architecture, Selenium tests can be slower, especially with multiple interactions.
•	Playwright: Generally faster, as it runs tests in headless mode by default and uses a more efficient communication model.
4. Browser Support
•	Selenium: Supports all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Internet Explorer.
•	Playwright: Supports Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and WebKit, with better support for newer browser features.
5. Ease of Use and API Design
•	Selenium: More verbose API with a steeper learning curve but widely documented and supported.
•	Playwright: Modern and user-friendly API with built-in auto-waiting, making it easier to write reliable tests.
6. Language Support
•	Selenium: Supports Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, and Ruby.
•	Playwright: Supports JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, and C#.
7. Parallel Execution and Test Scalability
•	Selenium: Requires Selenium Grid or third-party services like BrowserStack for parallel execution.
•	Playwright: Built-in support for parallel execution without additional setup.



8. Debugging and Reporting
•	Selenium: Relies on third-party libraries for debugging and reporting.
•	Playwright: Provides built-in tracing and debugging tools for better visibility into test execution.
9. Headless and Headful Mode
•	Selenium: Supports both headless and headful modes but requires additional configuration.
•	Playwright: Natively supports both modes with minimal setup.
10. Ecosystem and Community Support
•	Selenium: Larger community and extensive third-party integrations.
•	Playwright: Growing community with increasing support and integration options.
11. Network Interception (Mocking API Calls)
•	Selenium: Not supported.
•	Playwright: Supported and customizable for mocking API responses and blocking network requests.
12. Parallel Execution Performance
•	Selenium: Execution time for parallel tests is approximately 8 seconds, but it requires external libraries such as Selenium Grid.
•	Playwright: Execution time for parallel tests is approximately 7.2 seconds, with built-in parallel execution support
 

Performance Results:
Wrote sample test on both.
Test Execution Results
•	Selenium Execution Time: 14.87s
•	Playwright Execution Time: 7.8s

Execution Time Comparison:
•	Selenium:
o	Headless mode: 2.345s
o	Non-headless mode: 2.5s
•	Playwright:
o	Headless mode: 4.1s
o	Non-headless mode: 4.5s






Conclusion:



Pros and Cons
Selenium
Pros:
•	Supports a wide range of programming languages.
•	Large community support and extensive documentation.
•	Compatible with Appium for mobile automation.
•	Supports many browsers, including Safari and Opera.
Cons:
•	Requires Selenium Grid for parallel execution, adding complexity.
•	Slower execution due to WebDriver-based architecture.
•	Requires explicit waits for handling dynamic elements.
•	Limited network interception capabilities.

Playwright
Pros:
•	Faster execution with optimized headless mode.
•	Built-in support for parallel execution.
•	Better handling of modern web features like Shadow DOM and iFrames.
•	Native support for network interception and authentication.
•	Auto-waiting for elements reduces flakiness.
•	Simple and lightweight API, making it easier to use.
•	Better debugging tools and tracing capabilities.
•	Stronger handling of dynamic content and real-time interactions.
Cons:
•	Supports fewer programming languages than Selenium.
•	Limited mobile testing support compared to Selenium + Appium.
•	Smaller community compared to Selenium.
•	Only supports modern browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Edge).
Conclusion:
•	Use Selenium if you need broad language support, mobile testing, or a well-established ecosystem.
•	Use Playwright if you prioritize speed, modern web automation features, and built-in parallel execution.

Why Choose Playwright?
•	Playwright offers superior speed and efficiency, reducing execution times significantly.
•	It provides auto-waiting and built-in handling for dynamic elements, reducing test flakiness.
•	Its modern API is simpler and more powerful, making automation development faster and easier.
•	It includes built-in debugging and tracing tools for better test analysis.
•	Playwright is optimized for handling multiple browser contexts and parallel execution without additional setup.
•	It supports advanced web interactions, including network monitoring and authentication, out-of-the-box.
